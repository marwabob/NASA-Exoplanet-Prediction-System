# exoplanet_vetting_NASA2025
is an AI-powered project that uses NASAâ€™s Kepler mission data to classify exoplanet candidates as confirmed planets, potential candidates, or false positives. It employs a Stacking Ensemble model combining Random Forest, LightGBM, and Extra Trees to enhance detection accuracy and interpretability.

# NASA-Exoplanet-Prediction-System
An interactive Streamlit app for exoplanet classification using NASA Kepler data. It loads a stacking ensemble model (Random Forest, LightGBM, Extra Trees + Logistic Regression) to predict False Positive, Candidate, or Confirmed planets. Supports manual or CSV input, probability charts, metrics, and SHAP explainability.
